# ContrastAndBrightnessApplicationsOnImages
This application is for changing the contrast and brightness settings of openCV, matplotlib and numpy libraries on images.

It also compares the PNG and BMP format of the same photo as BMP Format has more distinct values than PNG format and the PNG Format Histogram result is more continious and narrow.

K-means algorithm is also used in the application.
